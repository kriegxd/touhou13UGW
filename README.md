TH13E.exe is the English patch, TH13.exe is Japanese.

If you get an error "The program can't start because d3dx9_43.dll is missing from your computer" 
	Then open RUN GAME.BAT
	This will run the game with the DLL, which is provided in the "a" folder.



(Here is code :p 
set path=%path%;%cd%\a\
th13e.exe)

Once that is all done Touhou 13 - Ten Desires should work on your computer.
